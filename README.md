# OOP-Design-Patterns
This is an ongoing project to demonstrate my enthusiasm for Object Oriented design. 
Through this repository, you can find sample code of some of the many design patterns dominant in the object oriented paradigm.
Feel free to reference the code in your own works at your own benefit.

## Introduction
When I decided to write my first Java app, I had no experience nor foundation in the fundamentals of object-oriented programming.
Unaware of visibility modifiers, all my variables were of default visibility and accessed directly (I honestly do not hold too much against direct access
nor am I hardcore "Okay, ALL THESE PROPERTIES MUST BE PRIVATE AND ACCESSED ONLY THROUGH GETTERS AND SETTERS", I like JavaScript (roast me now) and I don't mind
not sticking to the Java standard norm of information hiding, I am just trying to express my incompetence). Anyways, I had very jumbled and extremely redundant code and the worst part was when
I found out that I had been using the wrong logic in my duplicated code. Yep, there goes like 1 hour of my time, fixing everything.
Had I actually known the rules for writing maintainable code, that 1 hour could've easily been reduced to like only 10 minutes.

Fast forward a year or so and I am taking an object-oriented design subject at university, intrigued by the idea of patterns, I did the biggest nerd move and spent my spare time
reading up design patterns, specifically GRASP. Ever since, I have actually seen improvement in the speed taken to write and refactor code, and as much as I hate to admit it, 
object-oriented design has become my favourite topic in all my studies.

That being said, I feel like I haven't had the opportunity to exercise all these design patterns. So why not just do it on your very own? Yep, so that's my motivation for this project.

Okay, I am not a hardcore Java enthusiast, just putting it out there in case you're one of those anti-Javas, it just happens that this is my most knowledgable programming language due to university
and industry.

And to those that disagree with OOP. I'm not against you, some of your arguments I totally can get. However, OOP is probably here to stay and object-oriented design is the best way we cope with it.
