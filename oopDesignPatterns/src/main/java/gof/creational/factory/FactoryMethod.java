/**
 * Pattern Name: Factory Method
 *
 * The factory method is a simple pattern, often the first design pattern learnt.
 *
 * This pattern solves the issue of how does one manage complex object creation logic where different implementations
 * require different instances of a type.
 *
 * For example: We have many types of vehicles, however to operate these machines we may require people of different professions.
 *
 * Car -> driver
 * Ship -> sailor
 * Spaceship -> astronaut
 *
 * How do we effectively write code so that each vehicle can manage its own user(s)?
 *
 * The factory method says: create a common interface between the composing class and enforce all implementations to specify how they
 * want to create the dependant class.
