/**
 * Pattern name: Singleton
 *
 * Problem: How do we enforce up to a single instance of a class? How do we allow global access to an object while following
 * object-oriented paradigm?
 *
 * Solution: Create a class whose constructor can only be accessed by itself, which effectively restricts the user access on the
 * object to what it defines itself.
 *
 * The class should hold a static instance of itself which it instantiates when required.
 *
 * Finally, a getInstance() method should be provided to the external user to allow them access to this one object.
