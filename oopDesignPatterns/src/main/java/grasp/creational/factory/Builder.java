/**
 * Pattern name: Builder
 *
 * Problem: How do we effectively manage complex creation logic where we want to give the user the flexibility on how
 * the object is created? That is, allow the user to tweak certain fields while in full control on how the object is built?
 *
 * The naive solution would be to create a constructor for each possible combination or logic
 *
 * Solution: Create a helper builder class that holds a partially completed target object, and expose methods that allow the user to
 * change the target object until they are done.
 *
 * A code friendly way of making a builder involves returning the builder itself so that methods can be continuously chained.
